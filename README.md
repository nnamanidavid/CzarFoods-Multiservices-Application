# 🍎🥦 CzarFoods — Multiservice App on ECS Fargate with Service Mesh

A fully Terraform-provisioned multiservices application for fruits and vegetables, leveraging a **Service Mesh**, **Amazon ECS Fargate**, and a **Bastion Host** for secure access. Services are built using [nicholasjackson/fake-service](https://github.com/nicholasjackson/fake-service).

## 🧱 Stack

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Terraform** | 100% Infrastructure as Code |
| **AWS ECS Fargate** | Serverless container orchestration |
| **Service Mesh** | Service-to-service communication & observability |
| **Bastion Host** | Secure SSH access into the private network |
| **nicholasjackson/fake-service** | Simulated microservices for fruits & vegs |

## 🚀 Services

| Service | Port | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **Client Service** | 9090 | Entry point — routes to downstream services |
| **Fruits Service** | 9090 | Returns fake fruits data |
| **Vegs Service** | 9090 | Returns fake vegetables data |

All services use [nicholasjackson/fake-service](https://github.com/nicholasjackson/fake-service) as the container image.

## 🔐 Security Model

- The **Client ALB** accepts public traffic on port 80
- The **Client Service** only accepts traffic from the Client ALB
- Downstream ALBs (Fruits, Vegs) only accept traffic **from the Client Service SG**
- All ECS tasks communicate via **Security Group rules**, not open CIDRs
- The **Bastion Host** provides SSH access to private resources without exposing them publicly

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install) `>= 1.3`
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- An S3 bucket + DynamoDB table for remote state (optional but recommended)
